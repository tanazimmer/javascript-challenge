# javascript-challenge

Create a new repository for this project called javascript-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.


Clone the new repository to your computer.


Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Javascript challenge. Use the folder names to correspond to the challenges: UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2.


Add your html files to this folder as well as your static folder containing your javascript. This will be the main script to run for analysis.


Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.


Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file



Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)


Create a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!). <index.html>


Using the UFO dataset <static/js/data.js> provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. <static/js/app.js>

Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.



Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
